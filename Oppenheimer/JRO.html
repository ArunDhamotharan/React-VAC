    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5%; font-size: larger;"> <span style="font-weight: bolder;color: red; "> Julius Robert Oppenheimer </span><span style="color: purple;">(April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967)</span> was an American theoretical physicist and director of the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. He is often credited as the 
        <span style="font-weight: bolder;">"father of the atomic bomb"</span> for his role in organizing the Manhattan Project, the research and development undertaking that created the first nuclear weapons.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top:  1%; font-size: larger;">
        Born in New York City to Jewish immigrants from Germany, <span style="font-weight: bolder;">Oppenheimer</span>  earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Harvard University in <span style="color: purple;">1925 </span> and a PhD in physics from the University of Göttingen in Germany in<span style="color: purple;"> 1927</span>. 
         After research at other institutions, he joined the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a full professor in <span style="color: purple;">1936</span>. He made significant contributions to theoretical physics, including achievements in quantum mechanics and nuclear physics such as the Born–<span style="color: red; font-weight: bolder
         ;"> Oppenheimer</span> approximation for molecular wave functions, work on the theory of electrons and positrons, the <span
         style="color: red; font-weight: bolder;">Oppenheimer </span> –Phillips process in nuclear fusion, and the first prediction of quantum tunneling. With his students, 
        he also made contributions to the theory of neutron stars and black holes, quantum field theory, and the interactions of cosmic rays.

    <p style="text-align: center; margin-top:  1%; font-size: larger;">
        In 1942, Oppenheimer was recruited to work on the<span style="font-weight: bolder;color: red;">Manhattan Project</span>, and in <span style="color: purple;">1943</span> was appointed director of
         the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons program.
         His leadership and scientific expertise were instrumental in the project's success. On <span style="color: purple;">July 16, 1945</span>, he was present at the first test of the atomic bomb, 
         Trinity. In August <span style="color: purple;">1945</span>, the weapons were used against <span style="font-weight: 
         bolder;color: red;">Japan in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</span>. That remains the only use of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;margin-top:  1%;  font-size: larger;">
        In <span style="color: purple;">1947</span>, <span style="font-weight: bolder;color: red;">Oppenheimer</span> became the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and 
        chaired the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created United States Atomic Energy Commission.
         He lobbied for international control of nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race with
          the Soviet Union. He opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb during a <span style="color: purple;">1949–1950</span> governmental debate on the 
          question and subsequently took positions on defense-related issues that provoked the ire of some U.S. government 
          and military factions. During the Second Red Scare, <span style="font-weight: bolder;color: red;">Oppenheimer's</span> stances, together with his past associations with 
          the Communist Party USA, led to the revocation of his security clearance following a <span style="color: purple;">1954</span> security hearing. 
          This effectively ended his access to the government's atomic secrets and thus his career as a nuclear physicist. 
          Stripped also of his direct political influence, Oppenheimer continued to lecture, write, and work in physics. 
          In <span style="color: purple;">1963</span>, he was awarded the Enrico Fermi Award as a gesture of political rehabilitation. On <span style="color: purple;">December 16, 2022</span>,
           U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm ordered that the <span style="color: purple;">1954</span> decision to revoke<span style="font-weight: bolder;color: red;">Oppenheimer's</span> security 
           clearance be vacated
